Flow Pro Widgets for MSFS which replace the functionality of the default JPL/WBSim C152

These are the raw JS files used in my Flow Pro widgets for the JPL / WBSim Cessna 152.

There is a conflict somewhere between Flow and the 152's EFB/Tablet which causes performance to rapidly degrade until the game is unplayable. One solution to this problem is to disable Flow whenever you fly the 152. Another solution is to disable the 152's tablet, but then you're left without the ability to toggle instruments, external items, and manage all of the state saving and maintenance features of the plane.

This Flow project replaces the tablet's functionality with Flow Widgets.
